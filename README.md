# NITCBase

NITCbase is a Relational Database Management System Implementation (RDBMS) project that is intended to help an undergraduate student understand the design and data structures of an elementary RDBMS by implementing one Himself.

NITCbase follows an eight layer design, with the basic capabilities of a standard relational database management system which includes, creation and deletion of tables, inserting records, selection queries and indexing using B+ Tree. The final RDBMS implemented now will support elementary SQL queries such as create, drop, alter, insert, select, project, equi-join and also the queries for B+ Tree based Indexing such as create index and drop index. Currently NITCbase does not support concurrency.
